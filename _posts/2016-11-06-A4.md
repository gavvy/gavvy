For this assignment, Cole, Jamie and I teamed up and called ourselves blackngreen (blend of our fav colors..i know..so creative <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and decided on a few pretty random questions that were a little more interesting than the most generic questions such as "where do you live?" As you might imagine, I influenced Jamie and Cole to suggest some of these interesting questions while I came up with the rest. The following class day, Cole had felt particularly motivated in his spare time and had already developed a working script (U rock, Cole <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>). We played around with the script a few times and ran it twice. After we both had submitted atleast two different answers, pushed, pulled and verified all was well, we started working on decking it out with the fancy stuff. I set my intention on bolding the questions and spent the rest of class researching how to successfully do so. Of course my struggles were a result of just not copying the code identically and once I realized that, I created a working product. Although Jamie missed class for the president ([understandable](http://wncn.com/2016/11/02/president-obama-campaigning-for-hillary-clinton-at-unc-wednesday-afternoon/)), she definitely made up for it by working on making the script even more shnazzy over the weekend. She was excessively apologetic and I appreciated her dedication to being a good group member and making up for her absence (thanks, Jamie <i class="fa fa-key" aria-hidden="true"></i>). Working with a group went really smoothly. I hope to do this again in this class because it also provided insight on how other people address obstacles when designing this type of thing. The obstacles for this assignment were pretty minimal compared to ones in the past. I can't think of any profound epiphanies or thought-provoking accomplishments that ensued. However, problem-solving the bolding issue was a pretty important lesson in itself. I had searched "how to bold text" and had played around with it but for some reason assumed that the code did not need to look exactly the way it did on the example. Once illuminated to this mistake, I realized that I frequently do this type of thing while coding. I'll get really flustered and realize that the solution was pretty simple and obvious and would have come to me if I had patiently troubleshooted instead of assuming all hope was lost. I think this type of response is more subconscious because after attending UNC and basically becoming a phoenix because of STEM classes, my confidence as a student has burst in to flames along with the skin I needed to shed to become successful here. The result is that I have been so wrong so many times that sometimes I'll just feel perpetually wrong and need guidance instead of problem-solve. This is something that I have become aware of and am working on. Other than that issue, scripting has been fairly simple and straight-forward.
