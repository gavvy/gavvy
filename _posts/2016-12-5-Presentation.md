#Topic

I enjoyed working with Jamie on a previous project and decided to request her as a partner. As we brainstormed topics, I remembered reading an article that I found extremely interesting about Chief Storytelling Officers. I told Jamie about how tech giants were incorporating this interesting role because of how effective storytelling is in business. Jamie is a huge fan of microsoft and Bill gates so she was down for that, since Microsoft has one of the best chief storytelling officers in the world.

#Visonary Implementation

My strength was definitely designing the outline and the presentation itself. Jamie was pretty flexible with how we approached this topic so I took the reigns and mapped out the whole outline. This outline can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDHOIZvoSKRFlNkruE5b2C_09bQEnebm1T8e5PfY0Gs/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested. We both collected the images for the presentation. Our title slide actually includes a picture I took after a six mile hike in Colorado of a place called Cathedral Lake. 
Recording audio was a huge struggle. Jamie and I spent a lot of time navigating Audacity and trying to figure out how to use the software. We found a completely quiet room but still have background noise for some reason. Apparently fancy recording devices (blue snowball) aren't that effective sometimes. At first, we figured the presentation would be more cohesive with a single voice, so I recorded all of the audio. Then Jamie had to rerecorder about half to accomodate the requirement.

#Grunt Work
I transcribed all of the audio and inserted all of the asides (this took me a while). Then I added additional pictures for the backgrounds, chose new fonts, and continued to try and make it zesty. 

#Lightbulbs
* Troubleshooting audio and file formats resulted in a lot of lightbulbs such as how to import different formats and work with the software.
* adding in different images sometimes did not work so I had to troubleshoot that and make sure that the files were uploading to the right folder

#Skills and Attitudes
Even though reveal isn't too hard to use, the struggle is always real with technology and there are always challenges. We incorporated skills with coding we've learned all semester and refined the skill of collaboration in the cloud environment. I put special emphasis on diction when presenting on the audio because obviously, we have to tell a great story if we are talking about storytelling. This presentation also allowed us to improve at incorporating different file formats into a presentation.

# The future
* this class has left me with marketable skills
* Now I know how to create a presentation that is much more enticing than powerpoint
