```February 8```


>>  Beyond your eyes  
>>  the frothy tides  
>>  upon the fall  
>>  the waves collide  
>>  the moon  
    the guiding light above  
    the lone sailor  
    upon the seas of your love  
    the oceaness  
    her voice soft sounds  
    but when her eager worlds cascade down  
    you find me, driftwood upon the sand  
    as if you knew my dreams  
    like the back of your hand  
    sand soaking sun mixed  
    with spray of the ocean's thoughts  
    pondering the treasure map of your eyes  
    the oceaness floats upon the tides  
    the moon glows gold  
    beyond sun sparkling rays  
    as each wave unfolds  
    the boat of my soul sways  
    your eyes revealing tales of the olden days  
    You take me as I am,  
    A golden shell tossed upon the sand  
    rhythms running rivers of tides upon my surface  
    the oceaness leaves me with a purpose  
    the moon sinks, slowing the slithering waves  
    as the golden rays rise, the lovers' stars fade  

    If I were lost at sea  
    Only my sailboat to define me  
    you'll follow my dripping gold trail  
    on the love of the sun, you'll set sail  
    By the glow of the moon  
    you'll be able to tell  
    the constellations I formed  
    when the dusty stars fell  
    To think you'd ever see that many stars  
    While outstretched upon the bow of your boat  
    the hum of the waves soothing your soul  
    the universe reveals secrets while you just.. float  
    When the ocean mirrors the sparkly sky  
    you are just another traveling star  
    reflected and projected through the moon's eyes  
    seeking the golden glows from afar  
    Although touch is a distant dream  
    the frothy tides taking us far away  
    we are the same reflection of each golden day  
    sometimes closer to each other than we may seem  
    until we move beyond the dusty star haze  
    beyond the icy storms and rollercoaster waves  
    past the wise whales waving  
    and the occasional seagull's praise  
    forever floating towards the light  
    we may just find on a star-soaked night  
    the teasing tides tossed us towards each other  
    the oceaness grasped us in her hands  
    flinging frothy foam upon the sands  
    and when the white froth fades  
    melting, then licked up by the waves  
    two golden seashells glow  
    reminding me of two sailors I used to know
