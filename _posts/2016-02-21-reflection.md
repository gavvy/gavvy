I've learned that this class is better than math
calculus sucks my soul dry
I'd rather code, than wallow in wrath
and live my life makai
```

I wish I could add more reflections but I am honestly brain dead after trying to build a circuit and going down the rabbit hole of the interconnected worlds of science and math whilst conversing with my friends boyfriend
