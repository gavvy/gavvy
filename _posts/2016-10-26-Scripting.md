For this project, I focused on a poem I wrote about a year ago.  
Poetry has been a sporadic, rich and interesting journey but this poem in particular defied the usual context of my creative mind.   
I am not a runner or a morning person but on that very morning.. I was both.  
Sitting in my bright blue chair, hyper aware of the moments ticking by before chemistry started, I pushed myself to finish the poem instead of returning to it later.  
Upon finishing, I really liked it. Not all of my poems rhyme or have the same pattern or theme. My poetry is as dynamic as I am. But this one just felt special to me.
