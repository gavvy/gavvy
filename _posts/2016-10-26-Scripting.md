For this project, I focused on a poem I wrote about a year ago.  
Poetry has been a sporadic, rich and interesting journey but this poem in particular defied the usual context of my creative mind.   
I am not a runner or a morning person but on that very morning.. I was both.  
Sitting in my bright blue chair, hyper aware of the moments ticking by before chemistry started, I pushed myself to finish the poem instead of returning to it later.  
Upon finishing, I really liked it. Not all of my poems rhyme or have the same pattern or theme. My poetry is as dynamic as I am. But this one just felt special to me.
Included [here](https://gavvy.github.io/design/tool/2016/10/26/February8.html) is another goodie. 

>> To change this text into multiple formats, I used the pandoc command and converted it into [docx](https://github.com/inls161/assignment-3-gavvy/blob/master/9am.docx), [html](https://github.com/inls161/assignment-3-gavvy/blob/master/9am.html), [pdf](https://github.com/inls161/assignment-3-gavvy/blob/master/9am.pdf), [odt](https://github.com/inls161/assignment-3-gavvy/blob/master/9am.odt)

At first, my challenges were mainly just figuring out what did and did not work with markdown. Originally I wanted to change the background color and text but after ten minutes of scanning the web, I realized that markdown files do not include that feature.  
I incorporated a picture that was taken of me playing with seashells when I lived in Hawaii. These seashells only wash up on that specific beach on an obscure and heavily protected peninsula on the backside of the island of Molokai.   
Their significance is perfect to serve as a visual for this poem. This project also illuminated the awesomeness and easiness of incorporating intext links. Going forward, I will probably use this feature instead of embedding a link.  
I would like to explore the use of pandoc templates but for now I think my markdown file is sufficient for the purpose. I spent a lot of time formatting the markdown to add elements such as line breaks, page breaks, bullets, bold, etc.
