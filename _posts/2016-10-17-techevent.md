I went to a 3D printing workshop at Makers Space and learned the ropes and what to expect with 3D printing. Before I arrived, I brainstormed some interesting ideas such as 3D printing a collapsible flask. However, based on certain technological limitations- such as removing support material- I do not think 3D printing the flask would be the best method for design. Especially because I'd run into issues with collapsibility.The workshop helped me gain insight on the ideal uses of 3D printing and the potential for other projects. While I was there, I saw a guy working on a wooden design and it sparked my interest to explore that part of Makers Space. In the future, I want to go back and attend one of the workshops. I saw a bunch of people walking around campus last saturday with really large witches hats and was told that they had attended a workshop for it. One girl that I met told me about a lightsaber-building workshop. One of my goals has always been to make my own clothes, so I may explore the different options with the sewing machines there and see if any staff members can help me learn the ropes.
