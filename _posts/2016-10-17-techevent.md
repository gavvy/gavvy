I went to a 3D printing workshop at Makers Space and learned the ropes and what to expect with 3D printing. I went it with some interesting ideas such as wanting to 3D print a collapsible flask. However, based on certain technological limitations- such as support material- I do not think 3D printing the flask would be the best way to design this flask. Especially because I'd run into issues with collapsability.
