This assignment was particularly challenging for me because of the complexities of the group dynamic. However, simultaneously, the group dynamic resulted in a more solid result. 
Hence, this assignment not only taught me about the actual process of changing the script to interface with a database, but revealed the pros and cons of working with technology in a group setting.
Before diving into the specifics of what I did and what I learned, I'd like to address what I just said regarding group dynamics. I enjoyed working on this specific project in a group because Jamie and Cole both possess different skills that holistically resulted in a superior end product.
However, navigating the roles of each of the group members proved difficult in this type of format. Delegating tasks and troubleshooting was more difficult with this project because of the implications of merging the different repositories and running into merge conflicts.
As a result, not every group member shared in each role and certain roles such as converting the script to a database were assumed by the member that had more of an intuitive sense how to do it.
I wish I had more exposure to the process of problem-solving the database creation but Cole explained the final code line by line to me so that I would grasp it better.
Jamie and I spent the first day trying to figure out how to get the csv files from assignment 4 into the new workspace. Eventually we decided just to copy the text of the actual files and paste it into new files in the assignment 5 workspace.
We originally tried to follow the directions on the assignment 5 page on how to do that but we ended up way more confused than we should've been. In an effort to problem-solve, we copied the files over in the simplest way that we knew how. 
Cole was absent on that day, however, he showed up to class the next day with a functional database. 
Since he had taken the reigns with that, Jamie and I began brainstorming ways of improving the script and user interace. I created a readme file with instructions for the user. 
We began exploring more ways of improving user interface and I thought of incorporating the text conversion we learned with pandoc.
The goal was to generate code that would convert the user's response into a formatted pdf with either a table or bulleted list. I figured out how to convert the mysql database into a pdf but continued to run into formatting issues with the actual data.
After playing around with it a little, I reached out to my group members to update them and see if they had any insights on how I could move forward with problem-solving the code. As of yet, I have not heard back so I put my efforts on pause. 
Running into a troubleshooting wall, such as the one I feel like I've currently hit while going 90 mph, reminds me how important collaboration can be when solving technological problems. Even though creating things with others over the web can be difficult, problem-solving with others usually saves a lot of time and energy.
Beyond just the scope of this due date, I am going to talk to my group members more about optimizing the code and how they typically approach similar situations.

The scripts first ask a series of questions that pertain to the user's personal preferences. Then it proceeds to ask a series of random short-answer questions that have to do with the user's interests. Following the end of the script, the data is recorded in the database.
